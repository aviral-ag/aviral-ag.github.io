- name: Soil Moisture Balance Model
  image: "images/sections/projects/SMB.jpeg"
  timeline: "January 2024 - August 2024"
  summary: Performed frequency analysis on stream flows and precipitation in northern Ohio using the Vogel et al. (2011) method, utilizing 76 years of data from 133 stream gauges. Assessed the impact of trends on extreme events over the next 20 years for 100- to 500-year return periods through the application of magnification factors and reduced return periods.

- name: Flood Mitigation Analysis for Foster City
  image: "images/sections/projects/Flood.png"
  timeline: "September 2021 - December 2021"
  summary: Executed a data-driven flood analysis using concepts of expected loss and exceedance probability along with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Proposed a hybrid solution combining insurance and levees, reducing potential annual losses by 40% and eliminating risk of $400K+ damages.

- name: Water Resiliency Model for Central Coast California 
  image: "images/sections/projects/sustain_index.jpg"
  timeline: "September 2021 - February 2023"
  summary: Analyzed climate change impacts on Central California water infrastructure, using GIS and DWR data to assess basin vulnerabilities. Provided data-driven insights that supported five regional water management plans.Led a team of 3 in developing a Python script computing a dynamic resilience index for San Luis Obispo County, integrating 10+ data sources on water demand, supply, and climate projections to enhance drought preparedness efforts.
